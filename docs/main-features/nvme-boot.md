Works out of the box on the latest (after July 2021) Raspberry Pi CM4. 
If you're not using the latest Raspberry Pi CM4, youâ€™ll need to [update the bootloader](/dev/bootloader/) specifying the correct boot order.

Use standoff for the NVMe drive, 2mm (2.5mm works fine) high.\
**M.2 key M** connection port. Sizes: 
* 2230
* 2242
